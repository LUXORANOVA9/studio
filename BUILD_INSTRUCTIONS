# Build Instructions

This file documents the steps taken to simulate running 'npm install' and 'npm run build'.

## npm install

This command installs the dependencies listed in package.json.  In a real environment, this would be executed from the project root.

## npm run build

This command builds the Next.js application for production, using the settings defined in next.config.js. In a real environment, this would be executed from the project root, after 'npm install' is completed.
