# LuxoraNova Autopilot Empire v1.0

## Project Overview
LuxoraNova is a luxury fintech SaaS engine designed to automate wealth generation and global expansion. This MVP includes a tiered role system, AI agents, blockchain integration, subscription-based monetization, white-label licensing, and the $LUXO token to unify all reward systems.

## Core Features
- **Tiered Role System:** SuperAdmin, Admin, Broker, Client
- **AI Agents:** LUXBot (OpenAI) and SORA (Gemini Pro)
- **ERC-1155 NFT Access:** Unlock dashboards with NFT ownership
- **Global White-Label Deployment:** Customizable branding and rules
- **Responsive React Frontend:** Modern and intuitive UI
- **$LUXO Token Integration:** Unified reward system for access, referrals, and governance

## Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/luxoranova-saas.git
    cd luxoranova-saas
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client && npm install
    cd ../server && npm install
    cd ../contracts && npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    -   Create `.env` files in the `client`, `server`, and `contracts` directories using the `.env.example` as a template.
    -   Fill in the required API keys, Firebase configuration, and blockchain deployment details, including the $LUXO token contract address, OpenAI API Key and Gemini API Key.

4.  **Deploy smart contracts:**
    ```bash
    cd contracts
    npx hardhat deploy --network polygon
    ```

5.  **Deploy backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm start
    ```

6.  **Deploy frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

## Android APK
The Android APK is compiled with Firebase Auth + Navigation per Role, LUXBot Alpha integrated, Monthly Plan Expiry Test Feature, and Smart Contract Interaction UI.

- **Download Link:** [Download APK (Staging)](https://example.com/luxoranova.apk)  <- Replace with the actual APK download link.

## Role Test Commands
To test different roles, you can use the Firebase Authentication emulator and set custom claims for each user.

1.  **Start Firebase Emulator:**
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start
    ```
2.  **Set Custom Claims:**
    -   Use the Firebase Admin SDK to set custom claims for a user:
        ```javascript
        const admin = require('firebase-admin');
        admin.initializeApp();

        async function setRole(uid, role) {
          await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, { role: role });
          console.log(`Successfully set role for user ${uid} to ${role}.`);
        }

        // Example usage:
        setRole('USER_UID', 'superadmin'); // Replace USER_UID with the actual user ID
        ```
3.  **Test Roles in Frontend:**
    -   Log in with different user accounts and verify that the appropriate dashboard is displayed based on the assigned role.

## LUXBot Integration Steps
1.  **Set up API endpoint:** Ensure that the `/api/ask-luxbot` endpoint in your backend is correctly configured and connected to either OpenAI or Gemini API.
2.  **Configure API keys:** Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in your server's `.env` file.
3.  **Test the endpoint:** Send a POST request to the endpoint with a sample prompt and verify that the response is generated by LUXBot.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "How do I onboard a new client?"}' https://your-app.cloudfunctions.net/api/ask-luxbot
    ```
4.  **Integrate with Frontend:** Connect the frontend components to the API endpoint to enable real-time chatbot functionality in the client dashboard.
