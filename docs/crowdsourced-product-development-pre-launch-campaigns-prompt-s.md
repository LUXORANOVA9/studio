**Brainstorming Prompt S: Crowdsourced Product Development & Pre-Launch Campaigns**

You are an innovation strategist with expertise in crowdsourcing and pre-launch marketing. Your objective is to brainstorm ideas that involve the community in product development and secure sales or funding before full product releases. Your output should include:

- **Community-Driven Product Ideation:**  
  - Propose methods to involve users in suggesting or voting on new product features or designs via surveys, polls, and social media.  
  - Brainstorm incentive structures (pre-launch discounts, exclusive early-bird offers, or limited-edition products) that reward participation.
  
- **Pre-Launch Campaign Tactics:**  
  - Develop strategies for launching teaser campaigns on free platforms (YouTube, Instagram stories, LinkedIn articles) to spark interest and capture leads.
  - Detail steps to create a waitlist or pre-order system that validates market demand and generates immediate revenue.
  
- **Crowdfunding & Community Investment:**  
  - Brainstorm ideas for integrating crowdfunding elements into the LuxoraNova platform (using platforms like Kickstarter or a native solution) that also build brand loyalty.
  - Suggest ways to gamify the pre-launch phase by rewarding top contributors with additional perks or recognition within the community.

- **Metrics to Track:**  
  - Establish KPIs like pre-order conversion rates, number of engaged users, crowdfunding goal achievement, and social media buzz generated during pre-launch.

End of Task.
