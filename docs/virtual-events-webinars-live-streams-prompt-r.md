  - Propose varied formats such as live Q&As, panel discussions, product demos, or interactive workshops.
  
- **Monetization Strategies for Virtual Events:**  
  - Suggest methods for charging entry fees, offering tiered ticketing (free basic access vs. paid VIP access), or integrating sponsor presentations seamlessly.
  - Brainstorm follow-up revenue streams such as selling exclusive digital content, recordings of the events, or subscription-based access to a series of webinars.

- **Promotion & Engagement Tactics:**  
  - Outline free promotional channels (social media, email newsletters, community forums) for rapidly building an audience.
  - Develop interactive event features (live polling, chat moderators, instant giveaways) that enhance user participation and foster a sense of community.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  - Define metrics such as registration conversions, live attendance rates, post-event follow-up sales, and audience engagement during the event.

End of Task.
